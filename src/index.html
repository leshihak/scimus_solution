                  Divers are really astronauts; gliding weightless through the
                  ocean we observe alien worlds carpeted in vast fields of
                  colourful corals with equally bizarre, enthralling inhabitants
                  - from the foreign clicks of dolphins communicating to minute
                  technicolour slugs (nudibranch). And best yet, you don't need
                  years of gruelling training or a rocket to experience these
                  watery worlds, just four days and a eagle-ray-eyed (sorry)
                  ground control.

                  As the nights draw in, the temperature drops (we had a good
                  run) and businesses start to compete for the best Christmas TV
                  ad (move aside Elton, Waitrose's Stollen takes the crown), the
                  festive season is upon us. So, naturally, we've decided to
                  bypass all of that and look straight ahead to next year, which
                  is shaping up to be a good'un. From a very exclusive
                  expedition to the best new openings and off-the-beaten track
                  diving adventures.

                  As we (at least those of us based in Europe) are slowly
                  stepping into the cold of winter and dusting off our winter
                  clothing, here at Original Diving, we've compiled our list of
                  some top short-haul winter-come-spring diving destinations.
                  Here's a selection of places you can get to for a short break
                  where the temperature won't chill your bones and the waters
                  remain unfrozen. Enjoy!

                  This year I turn 30. At the start of the year I decided that
                  it was going to be a big year for me; figure out my five year
                  plan, set some challenges, say 'yes' to as much as possible
                  and go on some unforgettable trips. The five year plan is
                  still a work in progress, however I did say 'yes' to
                  completing a ski marathon so that doubled with a challenge.

            <p>
              Our approach differs from other travel companies; we are a group
              of dedicated divers, marine biologists and travellers who take a
              creative approach to tailoring luxury diving holidays.
            </p>
            <p>
              We focus on understanding what you want from your holiday, from
              trips centred entirely around diving to holidays with the odd dive
              included here and there. No matter your level of dive experience
              and knowledge, we will tailor the perfect holiday to your
              requirements using a thoughtful approach, focused on the small
              details that make a big difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our aim is to make sure every detail of your holiday is planned to
              perfection by working with you to hone and finesse your itinerary
              to your exact requirements, from ensuring logistics like transfers
              and guides run like clockwork to giving you access to experiences
              the average traveller wouldn't find. So you can sit back, relax
              and enjoy your Original Diving holiday.
